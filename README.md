## Welcome stranger, take a seat!

My name is Gaspar, I'm from Argentina, a few things that sparkle me with joy are procedural generation, automation and developing development tools.

I'm a C# software developer, I do the programming & design of all my software, which is made following the SOLID principles and aplying design patterns I learned in the way and in the university.

My current tech stack looks something like this:
